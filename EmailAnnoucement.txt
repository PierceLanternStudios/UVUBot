&gt; Evening All,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you to those of you who filled out our club interest survey. The
&gt; results are in:
&gt; - Numbers mostly support a mixed team.
&gt; - Schedules and ability to commit are widely variable.
&gt; - Most survey respondents say their interest is in additional
&gt; opportunities to play with a focus on skill development and
&gt; community-building (camaraderie).
&gt;
&gt; Based on these results, organizers are planning to move ahead with forming
&gt; a new Upper Valley mixed club team (!!) We will hold advanced level skills
&gt; and drills *practices* *2x a month*, *conditioning opportunities once a
&gt; week *(+ optional throwing practice), and send a team to *at least 2
&gt; tournaments*.
&gt;
&gt; Curious about this new team? We will be holding an informal info session
&gt; on *Thursday, March 21* at Ramunto's. Mostly this is an excuse to see all
&gt; your faces before spring actually hits, but we will be giving some details
&gt; about expectations and vision for the team and season and be available to
&gt; answer questions.
&gt;
&gt; Discussion points of the meeting:
&gt; - Mixed Division structure (what's changed in the last couple of years)
&gt; - Team vision (growth-oriented and community-based with a secondary goal
&gt; of being competitive) and expectations (come to practices)
&gt; - Opportunities to get involved / committee leadership structure
&gt; - Team Name! Come with your suggestions! We have a couple in mind, but
&gt; want community input.
&gt;
&gt; Also, SAVE THE DATE:  The team's first tournament, Antlerlock, will be *June
&gt; 29-30*.
&gt;
&gt; *Please note that hosting successful summer and fall leagues will continue
&gt; to be the priority of Upper Valley Ultimate. This team will exist in
&gt; parallel as an additional playing and skill/community-building opportunity.
&gt; *
&gt;
&gt; See you soon!
